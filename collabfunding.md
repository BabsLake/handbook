## How to get paid for a Cobudget Bucket

First, you need to figure out whether you're invoicing Enspiral Services or Enspiral Foundation. See the [Venture Profiles](http://handbook.enspiral.com/venture_profiles.html) if you're not sure.

Then, email either foundation@enspiral.com or services@enspiral.com with an invoice that includes:
* the total amount for the bucket
* a clear indication whether GST is included in your invoice (remember the Cobudget amounts are GST-exclusive)
* your name, contact email and bank account number
* whether you are invoicing for you personally or on behalf of an Enspiral venture
* the web address and name of the Cobudget bucket.
