# Collaborative Funding

https://www.loomio.org/d/LV48FDpk/enspiral-transition-to-cobudget-beta

Summary: We made a decision to transition Enspiral Foundation collaborative funding from Cobudget Alpha to Cobudget Beta.

Check out this slidedeck explaining the process and showing how the app works.

All Enspiral contributors (which you are if you’re reading this) have been added to the Enspiral Foundation Cobudget Beta group. You should have received an email notification. Click the link in there to set your name and password. Click the "having trouble logging in?" button if you need any help.
Log in to Cobudget Beta here: http://beta.cobudget.co

Everyone is welcome to propose bucket ideas (by clicking the pink plus in the app). Collaborative funding is meant to broadly further the points in our collaborative strategy, which you can see on the About page (scroll down). Comment on other people’s ideas and help them improve. Buckets can be put forward for funding at any time - bucket creators will see a “start funding” button they can press when they are ready.

Funds are distributed into the system in proportion to their financial contribution to the Enspiral Foundation. We plan to distribute the first money for spending in Cobudget Beta around Dec 1. If you get funds, you’ll get an email notification.

NOTE: Cobudget is definitely still a work in progress. Development is progressing really well. New features will continue to be released. The current app is usable but very basic. We appreciate your understanding and patience with any bugs.

FAQ

Do I need a separate account if I’m already a Cobudget Alpha user?
Yes, Cobudget Beta is a totally separate app. You’ll need to accept the invitation and create your new login.

I was invited on the wrong email, or I have multiple accounts on different emails.
Email support@cobudget.co and let us know which email you want associated with your account and we’ll sort it out.

What about Services collab funding?
That’s a totally separate process. Services is talking about transitioning to Cobudget Beta, but right now this pertains to Foundation collab funding only.

What are the main differences between the old process and this new one?
There are no longer monthly rounds. Buckets can be raised at any time. Your money is no longer “use it or lose it” - you can spend it when you want, or save up. Buckets are visible in the system so you can check the progress and comment on funded buckets.

I have ideas or suggestions for Cobudget features / design / etc, or I found a bug
Check out the roadmap to see what’s already in progress. Submit feedback on this form. If you want to get involved on an ongoing basis, we can add you to our Slack group where we discuss this stuff.

Feel free to post comments and questions here on this Loomio thread. Looking forward to everyone’s feedback!
