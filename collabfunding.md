## How to get paid for a Cobudget Bucket

### Invoicing for a business

Email foundation@enspiral.com with an invoice that includes:
* the total amount for the bucket
* a clear indication whether GST is included in your invoice (remember the Cobudget amounts are GST-exclusive)
* your name, contact email and bank account number
* the web address and name of the Cobudget bucket.

### Personal invoices

You might want to send an invoice to Enspiral Foundation from you personally, rather than from an Enspiral venture.

Fill out [this invoicing form](http://contract.enspiral.com/invoice/). It will create an invoice for you and send it to Enspiral Foundation on your behalf.
