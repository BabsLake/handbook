# Venture Stewards

Each venture has 3 member stewards, either on the team or not. They join when they are proto-ventures, and are the contact points for onboarding and offboarding. If ventures are not meeting basic expectations as defined in the venture agreement, venture stewards initiate support and then offboarding. If anyone has an issue with a venture as a whole, they talk to venture stewards.
