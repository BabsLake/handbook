# New Contributor On-boarding info
When a new contributor joins Enspiral, they receive a series of six email messages over six weeks for orientation to the network - how it functions and how they can participate. In the last email, we ask for feedback about their experience.

The message series is part of a project by the Ops Team at Enspiral to improve the experience of new Contributors coming into Enspiral. If you have feedback or would like to contribute to this project email [foundation@enspiral.com](mailto://foundation@enspiral.com)

So what does it mean to be an Enspiral Contributor?

Enspiral Contributors are the life of Enspiral. But what are you contributing to and how do you do it? Below is an extended version of our [People Agreement](https://enspiral.gitbooks.io/enspiral-handbook/content/people_agreement.html) which sets out what is required, expected and encouraged from Contributors in being valuable citizens of Enspiral.

Required :

  * Accept the invitation to the Enspiral Loomio group

  * Follow agreed Enspiral policies (such as the [Diversity Agreement](https://enspiral.gitbooks.io/enspiral-handbook/content/diversity_agreement.html))

  * Opt in after 3 months and every 12 months after that, and make a self-set financial contribution (see [Financial Agreement](https://enspiral.gitbooks.io/enspiral-handbook/content/financial_agreement.html))

Expected :

  * Participate in online communications channels and collective decisions on Loomio.

  * Allocate funds in [Cobudget](http://cobudget.co/#/groups/41) when you have them.

  * Contribute to the internal culture of support and generosity.

  * Help build Enspiral in your own way - no one here will tell you what to do.

  * If you notice something that can be improved, work on it or talk to people about it. Starting a [seed on Hylo](https://www.hylo.com/c/enspiral) or [posting a bucket idea in Cobudget](http://cobudget.co/#/buckets/new?group_id=41) is a great place to start.

  * If you access an opportunity through Enspiral, set it up to contribute back to the network in some way e.g. become an Enspiral Services contributor, contract Enspiral Ventures to work on it.
  
  * Learn about our social mission and [uphold our values](https://enspiral.gitbooks.io/enspiral-handbook/content/values.html).

Encouraged :

  * Attend Enspiral retreats and events

  * Host events, share your knowledge and skills through our [Chalkle channel](https://chalkle.com/enspiral)

  * Propose buckets in [Cobudget](http://enspiral.us1.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=62b0ebd5c3dbb30bced6e6cf9&id=7ec3a82a55&e=7add41283b), and work on other’s projects

  * Refer opportunities to Enspiral people and ventures

  * Respond to invitations to participate in network initiatives and contribute to setting the direction of the network
  * Do commercial work through ventures in the network to enhance your livelihood and that of others

Got some thoughts on this? For more background on [this agreement] and to ask questions, see [this Loomio discussion](https://www.loomio.org/d/N2DF7PeQ/-refactor-people-agreement).
 
Happy contributing!
