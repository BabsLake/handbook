**This book is in a very early stage of development. Much of it hasn't been written yet. Parts of it won't make sense.**

# About This Handbook

This Handbook's primary audience is Enspiral contributors, but it will be publicly available for others who might find it useful. The goal is to give everyone in the network as much clarity and context as possible, while sharing our structures and practices with the outside world as well.

The information in this handbook pertains to Enspiral Foundation Limited and the Enspiral network as a whole. Many Enspiral ventures and teams will have different processes.

This is living document that many people can contribute to improving and updating.
