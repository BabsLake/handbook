# About This Handbook

This Handbook's primary audience is Enspiral contributors, but it will be publicly available for others who might find it useful. The goal is to give everyone in the network as much clarity and context as possible, while sharing our structures and proactices with the outside world as well.

The information in this handbook pertains to Enspiral Foundation Limited and the Enspiral network as a whole. Many Enspiral ventures and teams will have different processes.

Most content in this Handbook is intended to be updated fairly infrequently (such as quarterly or annually). But this should be a living document that many people can contribute to improving and updating. Our processes for how this content is updates are under development.

There are a few specific sections that have more formal processes for changing. For example, Enspiral Agreements are changed by a formal decision by the whole network.

**To be added here soon:**

* How-to about updating or suggesing changes
* Links to other open documentation from around Enspiral (such as Loomio, Lifehack, Services, Dev Academy) 
* Contact info and further links
