# About This Handbook

The information in this handbook pertains to Enspiral Foundation Limited and the Enspiral network as a whole. Many Enspiral ventures and teams will have different processes.

This Handbook's primary audience is Enspiral contributors, but it will be publicly available for others who might find it useful. The goal is to give everyone in the network as much clarity and context as possible, while sharing our structures and proactices with the outside world as well.

Most content in this Handbook is intended to be updated fairly infrequently (such as once a year). But this should be a living document that many people can contribute to improving and updating.

Most of this handbook us open to be updated and improved by making a pull request. However, there are a few specific sections that have more formal processes for changing. 

**To add here:**

* How-to about updating or suggesing changes
* Links to other open documentation from around Enspiral (such as Loomio, Lifehack, Services, Dev Academy) 
* Contact info and further links
