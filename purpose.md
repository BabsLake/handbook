# Purpose

Enspiral exists because we believe a better form of human civilisation is possible. A civilisation which lives in harmony with the living systems it depends on and treats its diverse members with dignity and respect. We dream of a world where our political, economic, health care and education systems are effective, fair and sustainable.

We yearn for a human presence on this planet which is generative, resilient and beautiful. This is not a new dream or a novel one, it is shared by many people and is the heart of Enspiral.

These are quite interesting times to be living in. The disparity between our actual society and the one our hearts ache for is glaring and jarring. This is obvious to anyone with an internet connection and all over the world people are banding together and committing their lives to creating something better. 

We are proud members of this decentralised movement.

Our mission is to help more people to spend their lives working on stuff that matters. There is a trickle of human energy going into the greatest issues of our times and we want to help turn that into a river.

Values

Whether you are a Contributor, a Member, or serving as a Catalyst, you are expected to walk the talk of Enspiral and live the values of Integrity, Purpose, Commitment, Generosity, Good Judgement, Leadership, Engagement and Collaboration.

Integrity

To be a Member means to be trustworthy and to have a high level of personal integrity. Honesty and doing the right thing are just the starting point - true integrity means knowing who we are, what we value, and integrating that with our words and actions. We speak our truth even when it is unpopular and we do not compromise on what is important.

Purpose

We fundamentally believe our role on this planet is one of contribution - we are here to build a better world. We are idealistic, and we are pragmatic. We are people motivated by the heart and we act with considered intelligence. We love fun and new ways to do things, and we can persevere through the hard times as we understand things worth doing aren’t always easy. We are here to make a difference.

Commitment

Enspiral is really important to our members. For some of us it is our life’s work; for others it is our sole source of income. For all of us it is a big part of our lives and way up our priority list of where we put our energy.

Generosity

We give freely of our time and money to help others - this doesn’t mean we will go broke giving what we don’t have, but our natural impulse is to share. We make sacrifices to help those around us and actively look for opportunities to create and share abundance.

Good Judgement

When we offer someone membership we are giving them a binding vote in the most important decisions we face as a collective so we better be sure their judgement is sound. Everyone has their own areas of expertise and experience but on the whole we look for people who make good decisions.

Leadership

Our members don’t sit around and talk about what someone else should do to make things better - we act. That means we don’t always ask permission before starting something new and risk public failure striving for difficult dreams. Everyone should lead some of the time, no one should lead all the time and leadership should be balanced with active followership.

Engagement

In order for us to realise the benefits of distributed power and diverse viewpoints, people need to participate in decision making and discussion. It’s understandable that people get busy at times and step back temporarily, but overall engagement is important. This might mean jumping in on Loomio, attending members meetings, going to retreats, recruiting and supporting new people, and participating in Collaborative Funding.

Collaboration

We love autonomy and self determination, but one fundamental premise of Enspiral is that we can add more value working together than on our own. If someone in their hearts is a lone wolf and doesn’t think we can build something better by working together, then membership of this collective is not for them.
