# Purpose

Enspiral exists because we believe a better form of human civilisation is possible. A civilisation which lives in harmony with the living systems it depends on and treats its diverse members with dignity and respect. We dream of a world where our political, economic, health care and education systems are effective, fair and sustainable.

We yearn for a human presence on this planet which is generative, resilient and beautiful. This is not a new dream or a novel one, it is shared by many people and is the heart of Enspiral.

These are quite interesting times to be living in. The disparity between our actual society and the one our hearts ache for is glaring and jarring. This is obvious to anyone with an internet connection and all over the world people are banding together and committing their lives to creating something better. 

We are proud members of this decentralised movement.

Our mission is to help more people to spend their lives working on stuff that matters. There is a trickle of human energy going into the greatest issues of our times and we want to help turn that into a river.
