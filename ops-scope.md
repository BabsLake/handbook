Foundation Members Support (Senior Ops - Phill / Malcolm)

Adding & removing Members from Foundation Members Loomio group
Every 6 months check with Members to see if they still consider themselves Members. This is via Loomio, before retreats.
Schedule and announce 2-monthly members meetings, make sure each has a volunteer to facilitate, take notes, and host the Hangout and post notes afterward.

Companies Support

AGM/shareholder meetings, compliance paperwork
Create HelloSign documents for Enspiral Foundation Limited shareholder resolutions and send out to all Members for signing. 
Manage Enspiral Foundation Ltd on the Companies website and CompanyBox.co.nz, and administrate the issue and forfeiture of shares as members come and go

Foundation Collaborative Funding

Cobudget

Add/remove Cobudget users as contributors come and go
Distribute funds to users as they come in - when a venture contribution invoice is paid, or once a month distribution of Namaste/Lifehack funds to members (we’ll need to figure out the right process for taking out fixed expenses, but for two years in a row it’s averaged 50% so we might just go with that for a while to make it a lot simpler?)
When buckets are funded, update the collab funding my.enspiral account
When bucket sponsors complete work and ask to be paid out, remind them to mark their bucket ‘done’ in cobudget and give a final update (users can do this themselves but you need to make sure it’s done)
Occasionally check if unspent Cobudget funds (total is listed at top of the app) + Reserves = how much untagged money we actually have


Foundation Board Support

Question: Should this be done by a Foundation Member as bucketed work?

Schedule and attend Foundation board meetings, take notes, and report to members.

Role Optimisation

Making improvements within scoped budget to provide increased value to Enspiral Foundation
