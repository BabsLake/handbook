# Contributing to the handbook

These guidelines follow the [OPEN Open Source Manifesto](http://openopensource.org) modified for use inside Enspiral.

## Edit Permissions 

 * If you have edit permissions follow the [Gitbooks based workflow](#gitbooks-based-workflow).
 
 * Any Enspiral Contributor can become a handbook maintainer. Ask one of the [maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/enspiral/teams/handbook) to make you a fellow maintainer. If you want to get started and are familiar with github follow the [Github based workflow](#github-based-workflow)

 * To change an agreement document you need to follow the process outlined in the [decisions agreement](http://handbook.enspiral.com/decisions_agreement.html).

## Gitbooks based workflow

If you already have edit permissions you can use the [Gitbooks workflow](https://help.gitbook.com/editor/draft.html).

## Github based workflow

1. Make sure you have a github account and are signed in.
2. Fork the handbook repository to your own personal account

3. If you know how to clone a repository, do so. Change the files in your local repository and push up the changes to your github repository.

 If you don't, no worries. Just open up the repository in prose.io. The link will be `http://prose.io/#[YOUR GITHUB USERNAME]/handbook` and make your changes there. 
 
4. Once you're satisfied create a pull request from your repository to the `enspiral/handbook` repository.

## Handbook Maintainers

Handbook maintainers will merge contributions within 1-2 days. As a general guideline a maintainer does not merge in their own branches or pull requests. If they cannot get hold of another maintainer they may merge their own branches. 

## Improvements and Disagreements

If you think the content in the handbook is inaccurate or could be improved follow the process above to submit your own changes. The contribution process may reveal differences of opinion. In these cases, try to understand each others perspective. Consider starting a Loomio discussion to find agreement.
