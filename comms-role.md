# Comms Role Scope

The Enspiral Foundation contracts 

About Enspiral
Enspiral is a virtual and physical network of companies and professionals brought together by a set of shared values and a passion for positive social impact. The Enspiral Foundation supports the whole network and holds the social mission vision of Enspiral - more people working on stuff that matters.

Communications is vital to Enspiral, which is based on free-flowing information, transparency, and high-trust personal relationships. As a distributed network, staying in touch with one another is critical, and sharing our stories externally is key for finding new opportunities and having an impact on the world.

About the Role
We are seeking a part time communications person to join the Enspiral Foundation team. The other team members are Silvia, focused on internal and external relationships, and Phill, focused on ops/admin. The team checks in once every two weeks and will be there to support you and answer questions, but the role is largely self-directed. 

The time commitment is approximately 12 hours per month. You can work in Enspiral Space and remotely and set your own working hours, but we need someone located in Wellington. The start date is as soon as possible, ideally by early August or even sooner. The pay rate is $40/hour. The initial commitment is for 3 months, but there are likely to be opportunities to extend the role. This role is for a contractor (you can contact through Enspiral Services or independently).

To succeed in this role, you need to be excited about Enspiral and its unique structure and vision, an excellent writer and communicator, experienced with social media, and very comfortable with technology. You will have no boss, and will be expected to be self-managing and self-motivating. You will receive initial training from Alanna and Corinna, the people who have been fulfilling comms responsibilities up to now, but you’ll need to really make the role your own.

With such a low number of committed hours, the expectation is to maintain some basic functions and use your time strategically to continuously improve comms across the network. Here’s an outline of the tasks involved.
Enspiral News
Produce an internal newsletter every two weeks, with updates from around the network, interviews with Enspiral people, news from the ventures, etc. This is an established newsletter and you will be fully trained on the existing process.
Social Media
Manage Enspiral’s Facebook, Twitter, and private Google+ community. Keep on the lookout for content and share. Build the audience and expand to other platforms if needed. Manage Enspiral’s Buffer, and bring others in Enspiral on as content creators and to make social media more open and collaborative in the network.
Meetups
Enspiral co-hosts the Social Enterprise Wellington meetup group with the Akina Foundation. Work with our contacts there and the other Foundation Staff to plan and promote events every month or two. Attend when you can.
Website updates
Make incremental improvements to the content of the current Enspiral website, and work with the team that’s working on a redesign, to integrate the website into overall communications strategy. 
Blog 
The Enspiral blog is currently inactive. Make a call to either re-activate it, or remove it completely. There is potential for monthly updates with public highlights from internal news, social media, etc, with minimal extra effort.
Mailing list (external)
Start a mailchimp list with a signup on the website. Publish monthly updates, announcements, events, etc. Promote the list and build the audience.
Existing content
We have a large backlog of quite useful and high quality content like articles, videos, etc, which could be better used to help tell the Enspiral story.
Continuous Improvement
The Amazing Comms Working Group has identified a range of improvements for comms across the network. Work with this group to implement recommendations as capacity allows. There are many willing volunteers, and you can activate their potential with a little bit of coordination. Participate on Loomio and host occasional meetings.
Participate
The effectiveness of the comms role will be largely determined by simply knowing people in the network and being aware of what’s going on. You’ll need to be active on our online platforms (Loomio, Google+ Hipchat, Facebook, Twitter), and in person to strike up conversations, and seek out stories and news. Make sure people are aware that if they have something to communicate, you’re there to help.

Interested? Have questions?
Contact alanna@enspiral.com explaining why you’re interested in the role and the skills you bring, by the end of Sunday 27/7. You do not need to be a current Enspiral member, but you must be committed to staying or becoming a contributor (details of what that means here). We’d like to hear both about your skills and experience with communications, and about your interest in Enspiral specifically.
