# People Agreement


###Context
The Enspiral Network is a collective of people - at its heart Enspiral is simply made up of relationships. Everyone at Enspiral is a Contributor, and some are also Members. As Members are a subset of Contributors, they are expected to fulfil everything under “contributors” below, in addition to what’s listed under “members”. This agreement specifies these roles.
